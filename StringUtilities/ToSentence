#Here's an implementation of the ToSentence method in Csharp:
public static string ToSentence(string s)
{
    string[] words = s.ToLower().Split(' ');
    words[0] = char.ToUpper(words[0][0]) + words[0].Substring(1);
    return string.Join(" ", words);
}

#Here's how it works:
#1-The input string 's' is converted to lowercase using the 'ToLower()' method.
#2-The string is split into an array of words using the 'Split()' method with a space separator.
#3-The first word in the array (index 0) is capitalized by taking its first character using the 'ToUpper()' method and concatenating it with the rest of the word using the 'Substring()' method starting from index 1.
#4-The array of words is joined back into a string using the 'Join()' method with a space separator.
#The function returns the resulting capitalized sentence.

#Here's the examples of how to use the function:
Console.WriteLine(ToSentence("marcin jagiela"));   // Output: Marcin jagiela
Console.WriteLine(ToSentence("the LorD OF thE Rings"));   // Output: The lord of the rings

#Note that this implementation assumes that the input string contains only letters and spaces, If the input string may contain other characters, such as punctuation or digits, the implementation may need to be modified to handle those cases.
